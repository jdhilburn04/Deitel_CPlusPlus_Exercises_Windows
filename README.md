# Deitel_CPlusPlus_Exercises_Windows
This repository contains my solutions and practice exercises from the book "C++ For Programmers" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel. It serves as a structured learning journey through modern C++ concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more. This repository works for windows users using CMake.
